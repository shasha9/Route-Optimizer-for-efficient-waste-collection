# Route-Optimizer-for-efficient-waste-collection
A comparative study on route optimizing algorithms to find which is the most efficient in terms of time complexity,for finding optimal path for waste collection vehicle

**Introduction**

There has been a considerable increase in the amount of waste generated nowadays. So there should be a proper waste collection and management method to tackle this issue. Our project focuses on efficient waste collection which is an initial and important step of Waste Management. The current trend of research shows that for efficient waste collection it is necessary to collect waste from every household located in an area. 

Our goal is to visit every node (household) on an optimal route to eliminate wastage of time and fuel using waste collector vehicle as a resource. We shall use breadth first search algorithm to find the optimal route the vehicle should take. Several variants of this algorithm have been developed such as A* algorithm and uniform cost search algorithm. In our project we are trying to find out the best algorithm which gives an optimal route for the waste collection vehicle so as to achieve maximum work by using minimum resources. We will traverse the graph formed with nodes as houses, using all four algorithms by implementing codes for all of them. Then we will find out which algorithm gives the optimal result. The conclusion of our project will be one algorithm which is best suited in finding an optimal path for the waste collection vehicle. 

Optimization of route for the vehicle will help it in visiting only those houses which it has not visited previously. The current research is to study and compare the four algorithms i.e. BFS, A*,uniform cost search and Floyd Warshall algorithm to find out which is the best suited for developing route optimizer for efficient waste collection such that every node is visited at least once on an optimal route. Our project will help to overcome the drawback of existing waste collection vehicles which travel on redundant paths and thus take more time and consume more fuel.

We believe that our idea can contribute in efficient waste collection to some extent. This will save time and the same vehicle will be able to visit more areas. Thus, this solution will be an economically better choice against the vehicle following redundant paths. This will also help in reducing the spread of diseases like lung and skin infections which are caused by reckless disposal of garbage. After trying this solution for a small area, it can also be extended to an entire town or district for efficient waste collection.

**Methodology**

In this work we focus on the collection, transfer and transportation of solid waste from any waste generation sources (households, markets, institutions and offices) to the processing plant or landfill site.We will select an area in Dehradun and we will map the houses in that area in the form of a graph with houses as nodes of the graph. And then we will traverse the graph using all three algorithms. We will develop programs for all three algorithms and implement them to find out which is the most suitable one.

After that we will analyze which algorithm is the best in finding the optimal route. In our project we will compare three algorithms i.e. Breadth First Search, A* and uniform cost search algorithm to find out which algorithm is best suited for finding the optimal path that should be taken by the waste collection vehicle. We are comparing the variants of breadth first search algorithm to find out if they perform better than BFS or same as BFS. We will find a route optimizing solution to avoid the waste collection vehicle to take redundant paths and thus preventing it from visiting the already visited houses. This route optimizer will help in efficient waste collection as it will help in minimizing time consumption and fuel consumption thus making it more cost effective.

Each part contains huge amount of cost for waste collection or waste material
transportation. The proposed scheme optimizes transportation cost of each part of the system. Therefore, the total waste management cost for the whole system is optimized.
